* Week 2

** Overview
On this week they show how to build ciphers, a cipher is a couple of functions
(E, D) as that having a message *m* and a key *k* the followin is true

D(k, E(k, m))

if we encrypt a message m, with a key k it will result in a cipher c. This
cipher have to be inverted by the D function using the same key

Also, for somebody that is looking the network and seeing this messages go by,
the ciphers *SHOULD NOT* leak any information about the content of the original
message

This can be defined as a prove that non statistical test can see the difference
between a cipher and randomnes

** DES

Not use it!

Can use exaustive search

** AES

keys can be 128, 192 and 256

we split the message into 16 bytes, and put it into a form of a matrix

and we apply the follow 3 transformations with a exor of the key expanded:

1. ByteSub: each byte is substituted by another byte depending on a table
   , this remove liniarity
2. ShiftRow: row are shift to the left
3: MixColumn: columns are also mangled

we do this for 10 round

is secure! You can use it :)

** Encoding
It's a way to use the cipher we have like AES with messages that
are bigger than the blocksize but, that depend on the previous block.

This is important, because we could leak information if we treat each block of
the message independenly

for example:
  message m = "Hello World, Hello all"
  imagine we break this message into blocks = ["hello", "worl", "hello"]
  the cipher c0 and c2 (both with the word hello will be the same) and that
  the cipher is leaking information about the plain text

*** CBC (Cipher block Chain)

*** CTR (Randomized Counter Mode)

More secure than CBC
